DESCRIPTION:
This is a project of a modular tool that can be added in a plant pot in order to monitor your plant state and watering it when soil is dry. It also connects via SerialMonitor to a Processing sketch that sends data via MQTT (a useful IoT protocol).
The collected data could be used to enhance future productions or to implement other function such as mobile Apps , telegram Bots, SmartDashBoards etc...
